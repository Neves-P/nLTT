#' This function does nothing. It is intended to inherit is parameters'
#' documentation.
#' @param dt The timestep resolution,
#'   a value bigger than zero and less or equal to one.
#'   1/dt is the number of points that will be evaluated
#' @param phylogenies a collection of one or more phylogenies,
#'   where the phylogenies are of type \link[ape]{phylo}.
#'   This collection can both be a list of \link[ape]{phylo} or
#'   a \link[ape]{multiPhylo}.
#' @param time_unit the time unit of the branching times

#'  \item{"ago: "}{the branching times are postive,
